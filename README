Package usage
Escudo-UNAM and Escudo-IBT must reside in your main document directory if you want to use this logos. The style looks for these files to draw the logos on the cover page. You may customize the logos using the \logounam{path_file} and \logoinstitute{path_file} commands in the preamble to define the files location and name.

The \university{university name} command allows you to customize the university name, which defaults to 'Universidad Nacional Aut\'{o}noma de M\'{e}xico'.

In addition, \institute{institute name}, \rcenter{research center name}, \faculty{faculty name}, or \school{school name} commands allow to set the institution name that will grant the degree. The rationale for using different commands is to autoselect the correct gender for the definite article (see the second page in UNAMThesis.pdf). However, these are optional commands, in case you omit the institution name, the gender of the definite article in the title page is set by default to female ('la') to match with the gender of the word 'universidad'. You may customize it by using \@instituteartm to set to male gender the definite article ('el') or \@instituteartf to set it to female ('la'). The \department{department or program name} is optional.

The style implements environments for dedication, acknowledgements, foreword, resumen and abstract. Besides, there are command versions for all these environments (except abstract because it is already implemented in SWP) named: \makededication{...}, \makeacknowledgements{...}, \makeforeword{...} and \makeresumen{...}. These command versions are useful to interface with SWP due to some bizarre restrictions in the software; so, if you are using standard LaTeX (without SWP) please use the enviroments.

In addition, this style implements an environment (quotenat) for opening quotes (quotations commonly used at the beginning of a chapter).

The UNAMThesis bibliographic style enables the use of author-year schemes using the natbib package. Citation to e-print archives (e.g. arXiv) is possible using the eprint BibTeX field.
